Using Adobe Premiere Rush, create an introduction video for your project. The introduction should be about 30 seconds to 1 minute. You can decide on the format, but at a minimum it should include title slides and a video of you introducing the data or a voice over with some other sort motivation. You can use TechSmith for a screen recording or upload videos recorded on your phone.

The share tab will allow you to download the .mp4 or upload the video to YouTube. You can also upload the video to your TechSmith account.
